                        The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in
                        the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild
                        members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter
                        ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and
                        their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick
                        reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Cat communication
                        includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well
                        as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular),
                        the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
                        frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. Cats also secrete
                        and perceive pheromones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often
                        ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered
                        pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by
                        spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large
                        numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and
                        reptile species.

                        The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat.
                        Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. Felis daemon
                        proposed by Konstantin Alekseevich Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later
                        identified as a domestic cat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is
                        a distinct species, namely Felis catus. In 2007, it was considered a subspecies, F. silvestris
                        catus, of the European wildcat (F. silvestris) following results of phylogenetic research.

                    <p>The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15
                        million years ago. The genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago.
                        Results of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric
                        or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.
                        The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes
                        and roughly 20,000 genes. The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in
                        China around 5500 BC. This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic
                        cat populations of today.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Domestication</h3>
                    <p>
                        The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated
                        close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200
                        BC. Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.[48] Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.[13][6] Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.</p>
                    <p>
                        The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around
                        1200 BC. Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to
                        southern Europe. During the Roman Empire they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the
                        beginning of the 1st millennium.

                    <h3>Size</h3>
                    <p>
                        The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.
                        It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with
                        about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females

                    <h3>Skeleton</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12);
                        seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but
                        humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three
                        to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx). The extra lumbar and
                        thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis. Unlike human arms, cat
                        forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass
                        their body through any space into which they can fit their head
                    </p>
                    <h3>Balance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most breeds of cat are noted fond of sitting in high places, or perching. A higher place may
                        serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch
                        such as a tree branch. Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better
                        observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. A cat falling from heights of up to 3
                        meters (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on
                        its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the cat
                        righting reflex.[75] A cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall, if it has enough
                        time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90 cm (2 ft 11 in) or more.[76] How cats are able
                        to right themselves when falling has been investigated as the "falling cat problem".
