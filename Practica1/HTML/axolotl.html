        The axolotl from is a salamander closely related to the tiger salamander. Axolotls are unusual among amphibians in
        that they reach adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis. Instead of taking to the land, adults remain aquatic and
        gilled. The species was originally found in several lakes underlying what is now Mexico City, such as Lake
        Xochimilco and Lake Chalco. These lakes were drained by Spanish settlers after the conquest of the Aztec Empire,
        leading to the destruction of much of the axolotl’s natural habitat.

      <p>
        A sexually mature adult axolotl, at age 18–27 months, ranges in length from 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in), although a size
        close to 23 cm (9 in) is most common and greater than 30 cm (12 in) is rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their heads are wide, and their eyes are lidless. Their limbs are underdeveloped and possess long, thin digits.
        Males are identified by their swollen cloacae lined with papillae, while females are noticeable for their wider bodies full of eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Axolotls have barely visible vestigial teeth, which develop during metamorphosis. The primary method of feeding is by suction, during which their rakers interlock to close the gill slits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Axolotls have four pigmentation genes; when mutated they create different color variants. The normal wild-type animal is brown/tan with gold speckles and an olive undertone.
        The five more common mutant colors are leucistic (pale pink with black eyes), golden albino (golden with gold eyes), xanthic (grey with black eyes), albino (pale pink/white with red eyes) which is more common in axolotls than some other creatures, and melanoid (all black/dark blue with no gold speckling or olive tone)

        The axolotl is native only to the freshwater of Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco in the Valley of Mexico.
        Lake Chalco no longer exists, having been drained as a flood control measure, and Lake Xochimilco remains a remnant of its former self, existing mainly as canals. The water temperature in Xochimilco rarely rises above 20 °C (68 °F), although it may fall to 6–7 °C (43–45 °F) in the winter, and perhaps lower.

        Today, the axolotl is still used in research as a model organism, and large numbers are bred in captivity.
        They are especially easy to breed compared to other salamanders in their family, which are rarely captive-bred due to the demands of terrestrial life.
        One attractive feature for research is the large and easily manipulated embryo, which allows viewing of the full development of a vertebrate.
        Axolotls are used in heart defect studies due to the presence of a mutant gene that causes heart failure in embryos.
        Since the embryos survive almost to hatching with no heart function, the defect is very observable.

      <h3>Regeneration</h3>
      <p>
        The feature of the axolotl that attracts most attention is its healing ability: the axolotl does not heal
        by scarring and is capable of the regeneration of entire lost appendages in a period of months, and, in
        certain cases, more vital structures, such as tail, limb, central nervous system, and tissues of the eye and heart
      </p>
      <p>
        They can even restore less vital parts of their brains. They can also readily accept transplants from other individuals,
        including eyes and parts of the brain—restoring these alien organs to full functionality. In some cases, axolotls have been known to repair a damaged limb, as well as regenerating an additional one, ending up with an extra appendage that makes them attractive to pet owners as a novelty. In metamorphosed individuals, however, the ability to regenerate is greatly diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is believed that during limb generation, axolotls have a different system to regulate their internal
        macrophage level and suppress inflammation, as scarring prevents proper healing and regeneration.
        However, this belief has been questioned by other studies. Axolotl’s regenerative properties leave the
        species as the perfect model to study the process of stem cells and its own neoteny feature.
      </p>
      <h3>Genome</h3>
      <p>
        The 32 billion base pair long sequence of the axolotl's genome was published in 2018 and was the largest
        animal genome completed at the time. It revealed species-specific genetic pathways that may be responsible
        for limb regeneration.
